        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Computer science is the study of computation, automation, and information. Computer science spans
            theoretical disciplines (such as algorithms, theory of computation, information theory, and automation) to
            practical disciplines (including the design and implementation of hardware and software).Computer
            science is generally considered an academic discipline and distinct from computer programming</p>
